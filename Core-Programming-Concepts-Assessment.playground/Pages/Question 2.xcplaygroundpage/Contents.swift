 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
var sellingPrice = Double ()
print("the reason for using Double is its capability of supporting decimal numbers.")
var copiesSold = Int ()
print("because selling a half book or a quarter bokk or... is not possible")
let bookName = String()
let authorName = String()
let yearPublished = String()
print("the data type which supports  characters and numbers togheter is String; and the reason for clasifying these datas as constants is, the year published never changes after one point ")
